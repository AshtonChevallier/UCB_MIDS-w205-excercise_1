For finding best state, I couldn't do quite the same analysis for hosptials because the meta score would weight the size of the state too heavily. When dealing with hospital to hospital, all cities in american can have similar sized hospitals, but not all states are going to be the same size. The meta score I used this time was the log of aggregate scores * the avg percent score / variance. The log mitigates the effect of the state being too big, but still emphasizing good average scores and low variance.
