Lastly, to answer the question whether average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses, I did a simple Pearsons correlation calculation on the entire dataset of average hospital scores against average survey response.

The real trick here was to make sure we did a proper analysis on the surveys. The data dictionary wasn't very clear on what the meta score columns HCAHPS Base Score   HCAHPS Consistency Score meant. So instead, I took advantage of the fact my ER diagram forced the survey data into row format. This way I could more easily calculate the the real average survey response and compare it to the hospital score and the variability score.
